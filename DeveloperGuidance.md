# Developer Guidance – Do’s and Don’ts

| **Do’s (Green – Allowed)** | **Don’ts (Red – Blocked)** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ✅ Use minimal, focused code snippets | 🚫 Never paste `.env` files |
| ✅ Redact or mask any secrets before sharing | 🚫 Never share private keys, tokens, or passwords |
| ✅ Use only **approved AI endpoints** | 🚫 Never share customer data (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.) |
| ✅ Rotate credentials immediately if accidentally pasted | 🚫 Never share entire repositories |
| ✅ Use non-production / sample configs for context | 🚫 Never share production configurations |

# ⚠️ Yellow Zone – Use With Caution
- Share only **generic or mock code** when unsure.  
- Validate AI-generated output against **org coding standards & security guidelines**.  
- Treat all AI responses as **unverified until peer-reviewed**.

**Reminder:**  
AI code assistants are **productivity enhancers**, not replacements for secure development practices. All outputs must still undergo **code review, testing, and compliance checks**.
